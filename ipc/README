Heterogeneous IPC Module
------------------------
IPC module is provided as user space library (libipc.so). Apart from
providing APIs for L2-L1 communication, a hugepage based user space
shared memory manager is also provided as a user space library (libmem.so).
In order to use IPC services, user space application needs to be linked
with these libraries.

IPC support for Multiple Application
------------------------------------
Support added for accessing an IPC channel by multiple applications, simultaneously.
This support is disabled by default and can be enabled  during compile time using a
compilation flag CONFIG_LOCK.

If this support is enabled then, internally, a lock is obtained on IPC channel before
performing any Rx, Tx operation on that channel. This will be an overhead in case where
only a single application is using the IPC Module.

Directory Structure
-------------------
ipc/include     -       Include directory for IPC public and private
                        header files
ipc/lib         -       Source code of IPC, user space ipc helper
                        memory manager, user space dma driver
fsl_shm         -       Source code of user space Shared Memory Manager
dsp_boot        -       Source code of DSP boot loader
test            -       Reference Test application which uses IPC channels

Compilation Procedure
---------------------
1. Set KERNEL_DIR as the path of linux soruce code
2. Set CROSS_COMPILE as the <path of toolchain>/.../powerpc-linux-gnu-
3. run make
4. libipc.so, libmem.so, ipc_test,
	      ipc_test67, dump_mem - gets created under ipc directory ,
	      libdspboot.so copied from dsp_boot directory
	      dsp_bt, libdspboot.so - gets created under
			     dsp_boot directory
5. For enabling access of IPC channel by multiple application, pass "CONFIG_LOCK=1"
flag as an argument to make as follows:
     make CONFIG_LOCK=1

bootargs Required
-----------------
Please set following bootargs, shown as example:
default_hugepagesz=256m
hugepagesz=256m
hugepages=1
max_num_ipc_channels=64
max_channel_depth=16

Test Application (Single RAT only Solutions)
----------------
Test applications (ipc_test, ipc_test67) can be started once the DSP image
(ipc_9132_multimode_dbg.bin/ipc_9131_dbg.bin), present in rootfs under
/dsp_images is loaded sucessfully by dsp_bt application.

Test runs with 6 channels, where for each pair of channels PowerPC is producer
and DSP is consumer. For each of the channel pairs a seperate thread is
started by the Linux test application.

The channel pairs are
2-3	Channel 2 is a MSG Channel where DSP is consumer
	Channel 3 is a PTR Channel where PowerPC is consumer.

	Linux sends a message on Channel 2, DSP returns back the pointer of the
	message on channel 3.

	On Channel 2, DSP receives VIRQ
	On Channel 3, Linux polls for recv pointer.

4-5	Channel 4 is a PTR channel where Linux is a consumer.
	Channel 5 is a MSG channel where DSP is a consumer.

	Linux receives a ptr on channel 4, copies the length number of characters
	from the pointer into a local buffer and sends the buffer on to channel 5.

	On Channel 4, Linux Polls
	On Channel 5, DSP Polls

6-7	Channel 6 is a TX Request Channel where Linux is producer.
	Channel 7 is a PTR channel were linux is consumer.

	Linux sends a dummy TX request fapi message a set of buffer using DMA.
	DSP returns to linux a pointer which points to a memory location
	containing first 16 bytes of fapi message and the first buffer.

For channel 2-3,4-5
$./ipc_test

For Channel 6-7
$./ipc_test67

Test Application (Multi RAT)
----------------
ipc_test and ipc_test67 are upgraded for testing multirat support from PA side.
rat id should be added after the executable name

Format
------
  ./ipc_test <rat_id>
  ./ipc_test <0/1>
OR
  ./ipc_test

For channel 2-3,4-5
$./ipc_test 1

For Channel 6-7
$./ipc_test67 1

        for eg:
                ipc_test or ipc_test 0 would run the test for rat_id 0
                ipc_test 1 would run the test for rat_id 1

Note: DSP multi rat enabled binary(ipc_9132_multimode_dbg.bin) must be loaded before
any pa tests.

Memory Dump
-----------

dump_mem demo application can be found out in /ipc directory in the rootfile
system.
It can dump the Memory contents of address range to a location specified by
the application.

Requirements:
1. mem_dump_cfg.txt- Memory areas that needs to be dumped are specified in this    file. Each memory area needs to be specified in terms of start address and      size. Multiple discontiguous memory areas can be specified like following:
   0x37000000 0x100
   0x38000000 0x200
2. The address and size should be in hexadecimal format.
3. The start addresses needs to be page aligned.

Steps to Run:
1. cd /ipc
2. Run ./dump_mem
3. The output log is generated in the file named Memory_dumped.txt
4. cat Memory_dumped.txt
dump_memory_dsp status is (768) 0x300

  00000010  370000e8  b0022d64  00000960

DSP Recovery
------------
There is no need to rebot the system completely if some problem occurs at DSP
side. Now it is possible for L2 to initiate the DSP recovery. Following BSP API
is available for L2 for performing DSP Recovery:

/*************************************************************************
 * * @fsl_restart_L1
 * *
 * *  Triggers the DSP Recovery and re-loads/start DSP image
 * *
 * * ipc[in] . IPC handle returned by fsl_ipc_init
 * * fname[in] . absolute path of DSP/L1 image to be re-loaded
 * *
 * * Return: On Success, zero is returned
 * *                 On Failure, non-zero value is returned.
 * *
 * * Description
 * * It re-initializes all IPC channels and then generates a VNMI towards DSP
 * * so that DSP can perform recovery. It furthers re-loads and starts the
 * * DSP/L1 image upon receiving `DSP Ready. indication from DSP.
 * ************************************************************************/
int fsl_restart_L1(fsl_ipc_t ipc, char *fname);

DSP Recovery Test Applicationi:

Format
------
 ./dsp_recover <rat_id>
 ./dsp_recover <0/1>
OR
 ./dsp_recover

  dsp_recover or dsp_recover 0 would run the test for Non-Multi RAT L1
  dsp_recover 1 would run the test for Multi RAT enabled L1
