This is the first release of the Heterogeneous IPC module.
The IPC layer runs a library in user space which is compiled with a
user space application.

Directory Structure
-------------------
include	-	Include directory for IPC public and private header files
lib	-	Source code of 	:IPC,
				:user space ipc helper memory manager
				:user space dma driver
test	-	Reference Test application which uses IPC channels

Compilation Procedure
---------------------
1. Set KERNEL_DIR as the path of linux soruce code
2. Set CROSS_COMPILE as the <path of toolchain>/.../powerpc-linux-gnu-
3. run make
4. ipclib.a and ipc_test would be created
	ipclib.a is the library which the ipc_test statically links to.

BootArgs Required
-----------------
Please set the bootargs as shown as example:
default_hugepagesz=256m
hugepagesz=256m
hugepages=1
max_num_ipc_channels=64
max_channel_depth=16

Test Application
----------------
The Test application is run after the DSP image has been loaded by the
dsp_bt application. To run the test execute the ipc_test application as

The Test is run with 6 channels, where for each pair
of channels linux is producer and DSP is consumer
For each of the channel pairs a seperate thread is started by the Linux test
application.

The channel pairs are
2-3	Channel 2 is a MSG Channel where DSP is consumer
	Channel 3 is a PTR Channel where Linux is consumer.

	Linux sends a message on Channel 2, DSP returns back the pointer of the
	message on channel 3.

	On Channel 2, DSP recieves VIRQ
	On Channel 3, Linux polls for recv pointer.

4-5	Channel 4 is a PTR channel where Linux is a consumer.
	Channel 5 is a MSG channel where DSP is a consumer.

	Linux recieves a ptr on channel 4, copies the length number of characters
	from the pointer into a local buffer and sends the buffer on to channel 5.

	On Channel 4, Linux Polls
	On Channel 5, DSP Polls

6-7	Channel 6 is a TX Request Channel where Linux is producer.
	Channel 7 is a PTR channel were linux is consumer.

	Linux sends a dummy TX request fapi message a set of buffer using DMA.
	DSP returns to linux a pointer which points to a memory location
	containing first 16 bytes of fapi message and the first buffer.

For channel 2-3,4-5
$./ipc_test

For Channel 6-7
$./ipc_test67
